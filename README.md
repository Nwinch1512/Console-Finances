# Console-Finances

## Description

This repository contains all files relating to the week 4 front end coding bootcamp challenge of using JavaScript to undertake analysis of financial information relating to profits and losses. I was motivated to complete this project because I wanted to learn how to access data from a 2 dimensional array and practice my JavaScript skills to undertake analysis on the data. This webpage provides the results to the challenge in a table format which displays on the webpage in addition to displaying in the console.

Completing this project enabled me to implement pseudocoding and rubber ducking to think through the problem. The project also enabled me to practice using for loops to iterate over the array. The most challenging part for me was figuring out how to access the second column of data in the array and how to calculate the minimum and maximum from the monthly change values.

As per guidance on Bootcamp spot, the average change has been calculated by calculating the monthly change in profits across the 86 month period and dividing this by 85. The greatest increase in profits refers to the month which experienced the greatest month-on-month increase over the 86 month period. The greatest decrease in profits refers to the month which experienced the greatest month on month decrease over the 86 month period.
